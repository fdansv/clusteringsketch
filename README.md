## To use

Download [Processing](http://processing.org) from its website. With git navigate to the folder where your Processing sketches are stored, and clone the repo. That should be enough for you to edit and test the application. Search in Google for ways of using Processing with your favorite IDE (I use [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.slideshare.net/eskimoblood/processing-in-intellij)).
